# Data Model Final

## Getting Started

First of all, setup all constant variables in `constants.py`. (As this is a PoC, let's avoid those fancy things)

This project is using [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) as package manager, yet you still can use `pip` if you want.

### Run with `pdm`

```shell
pdm install
pdm run python main.py
```

### Run with `pip`

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
